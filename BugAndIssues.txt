- Appendix D: "where auxiliary function w ⊏ T is a predicate that holds when"
issue: "⊏ should be ≺"

- Appendix D: "If e ⊏ T and T ∈ ran(R), then e ∈ dom(V ) ∪ {⊥}"
issue: "⊏ is not defined anywhere, I'm not certain what it should be"

- Appendix C: Nullable cachelet indexes could be more clear

- Section V (C: Runtime State):
"e use μ{l} to refer to μ(b)(δ) where α(l) = ⟨b; o⟩" -> should ⟨b; o⟩ be ⟨b; δ⟩

- Appendix C:
    - second rule for cachelet deallocation has is missing a bracket
    - extra "c" after the "F"
